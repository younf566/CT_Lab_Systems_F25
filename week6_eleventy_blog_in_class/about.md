## What this site is

This site is an experimental, student-made digital collection that presents short essays, reflections, and journal-style pieces about culture, knowledge, and public life. It uses a clean editorial layout inspired by small press magazines: a left column for navigation and hero content, and a right column for the latest pieces.

The project demonstrates:

- A minimal Eleventy setup for content-driven static sites
- Simple client-side filtering by category (reflection, journal)
- Lightweight typographic styling using a self-hosted display face
- Small presentation scripts for a playful hero title and image rotator

If you want to get in touch or contribute, add a post in the `posts/` folder and push the changes â€” the build will pick it up.
