Every time racial hierarchy in the U.S. has been challenged, it has been met with organized backlash — a coordinated attempt to reassert white dominance and suppress knowledge. W.E.B. Du Bois called this “the propaganda of history” — a massive effort to rewrite Reconstruction, justify Jim Crow, and erase the intellectual foundations of Black liberation.

Southern states once tried to obliterate printed records of instruction. Confederate monuments were not built after the Civil War, but decades later — during the Jim Crow era and again during the civil rights movement — as symbols of historical revisionism and white supremacy. Each wave of racial progress has been met by a counter-wave of epistemic control.

The current repression of anti-genocide and pro-Palestinian protests fits neatly into this pattern. Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim scholars have been smeared with baseless accusations of antisemitism for over two decades — a campaign that accelerated after 9/11 and has been reaffirmed by U.S. media and educational institutions ever since.

This is not a new moral panic. It’s a continuation of America’s oldest reflex: to suppress inconvenient truths and silence those who challenge imperial narratives. The refusal to acknowledge Palestinian life and suffering — even amid overwhelming evidence of atrocity — exposes the limits of the liberal “free speech” framework.
