The natural reaction from writers, educators, and researchers has been to rally under the banner of free speech. It’s a vital defense — especially within courts, where the only available “language game” is legal protection. But outside of litigation, an abstract defense of speech risks flattening what’s truly at stake.

What are we defending when we defend “speech”? What kinds of speech, and for whom? What activities of learning, doubting, and questioning are we fighting to preserve?

The uncritical lionization of figures like Charlie Kirk by liberal commentators such as Ezra Klein and Thomas Chatterton Williams reveals this flattening. Kirk is framed as a “persuasive intellectual of the right,” a tribune of reasoned debate. But anyone familiar with the far-right media ecosystem knows that his performances were never about persuasion. They were acts of domination — a grown man funded by billionaires performing control over teenagers for viral content.

His “speech acts” were not exercises in reasoned discourse, but in resentment and humiliation. These should not be paradigms of free expression to defend. Yet, the liberal tendency to treat all speech as equally valid — as if every arena were a courtroom — blurs the distinction between knowledge production and propaganda.
