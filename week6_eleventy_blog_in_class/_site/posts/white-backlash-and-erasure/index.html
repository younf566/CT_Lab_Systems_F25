    <p>Every time racial hierarchy in the U.S. has been challenged, it has been met with organized backlash — a coordinated attempt to reassert white dominance and suppress knowledge. W.E.B. Du Bois called this “the propaganda of history” — a massive effort to rewrite Reconstruction, justify Jim Crow, and erase the intellectual foundations of Black liberation.</p>
<p>Southern states once tried to obliterate printed records of instruction. Confederate monuments were not built after the Civil War, but decades later — during the Jim Crow era and again during the civil rights movement — as symbols of historical revisionism and white supremacy. Each wave of racial progress has been met by a counter-wave of epistemic control.</p>
<p>The current repression of anti-genocide and pro-Palestinian protests fits neatly into this pattern. Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim scholars have been smeared with baseless accusations of antisemitism for over two decades — a campaign that accelerated after 9/11 and has been reaffirmed by U.S. media and educational institutions ever since.</p>
<p>This is not a new moral panic. It’s a continuation of America’s oldest reflex: to suppress inconvenient truths and silence those who challenge imperial narratives. The refusal to acknowledge Palestinian life and suffering — even amid overwhelming evidence of atrocity — exposes the limits of the liberal “free speech” framework.</p>
