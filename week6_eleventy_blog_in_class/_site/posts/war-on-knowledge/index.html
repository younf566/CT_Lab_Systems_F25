    <p>Every week brings a new escalation — policy threats, lawfare, brutal funding cuts, and the weaponization of both the border regime and the very language of discrimination. These are not isolated acts of cruelty, but part of a coordinated assault on knowledge production itself — particularly within higher education.</p>
<p>Vice President J.D. Vance, a Yale Law graduate, once declared in a 2021 speech titled “The University’s Power is the Enemy” that Americans must “honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.” That speech, given three years ago, now reads less as rhetoric and more as prophecy.</p>
<p>Ironically, the American university system is far from the radical leftist utopia conservatives imagine it to be. The neoliberal university has become a machine for converting students into indebted human capital — relying on precarious adjunct labor and bloated administrative hierarchies. It serves capital’s interests far more faithfully than it nurtures rebellion.</p>
<p>And yet, despite this corporatization, universities have recently proven their loyalty to power. Across the country, institutions have fired, censored, suspended, and expelled scholars and students for protesting Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Trump’s conspiracy about universities as incubators of a radical left isn’t just false — it’s projection.</p>
<p>But his followers are right about one thing: education remains dangerous to fascism. Learning, organizing, and challenging received wisdoms — as seen in anti-war movements from Vietnam to Gaza solidarity encampments — threatens authoritarian order. A fascist government’s first instinct is to shut down the sites where people learn to think critically and find one another.</p>
